 /* 
  *  ASSIGNMENT
  *  Go to https://www.arduino.cc/reference/tr/language/functions/communication/serial/
  *  Read the descriptions of:
  *     read()
  *     readString()
  *     readStringUntil()
  *     setTimeout()
  *     
  *  Using each of the three read functions, have the user 
  *  enter their Name, Age, and Favorite Color
  *  
  *  To the Serial Monitor write out:   
  *     It is nice to meet you, <name>
  *     Did you know you are <xxx> months old      
  *         (note:you need to convert years to months)
  *     Wow, my favoite color is also <color>
  * 
  *  Remember: the enter key or send button returns a '\n'.
  *  When running this program, experiment with being slow 
  *  to enter your string, as this will give you a feel 
  *  for how setTimeout() works.
